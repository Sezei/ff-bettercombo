# ff-bettercombo
this funny thing literally just makes you have an on-screen combo counter that's easier to read than the downstairs-stats thing. requires 'Info Bar' to be true in settings while 'Opponent's info bar' being false.

## How to load the funny?
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greasemonkey123/ff-bettercombo/main/load.lua",true))()
```
yeah, that's all you need.
